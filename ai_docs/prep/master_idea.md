# Master Idea Document

## End Goal

My app helps people who've lost microbiome diversity (parents, biohackers, health-conscious individuals, longevity seekers, athletes) restore and rebuild their gut microbiome through personalised soil microbiology for better food growing protocols using RAG-powered AI that delivers personalised advice based on their needs and knowledge level—basically an interactive coach and mentor.

## Specific Problem

People have lost significant microbiome diversity (varying by individual), and this loss affects everyone in some way—may lead to persistent symptoms (IBS, anxiety, weakened immunity), thousands spent on supplements that don't work, and feeling stuck despite trying everything. Current solutions like probiotics **rarely restore missing microbes because most probiotic strains are ones people already have**. While some people may still carry these beneficial microbes, most people lack exposure to them. The **missing beneficial microbes are primarily found in seeds (via endophytes) and are enhanced through soil fungal networks**—different plant species share different microbes and awaken others in the soil, giving enhanced microbial abilities and nutrient density. The problem: **no one connects the dots between soil fungal networks, plant diversity, seed-based endophyte transfer, climate timing, and specific health outcomes**.

## All User Types

## Core Foundational Principle

**CRITICAL CONCEPT:** At least 4 different plant families (more is better) planted close enough so roots can exchange microbes through soil fungal networks. This principle relies on **quorum sensing** to tip the microbial community from pathogenic to beneficial, with **Brix measurement** used to validate plant performance and microbial success.

This is the absolute fundamental principle that makes this method of growing work—everything else in the app supports implementing this core concept.
