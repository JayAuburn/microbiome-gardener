⚙️ Technical Risks & Senior-Level Recommendations
Real-time AI Model Switching Performance

Clearly implement caching strategies.

Clearly set timeouts and handle errors gracefully.

Unified Conversation History Scalability

Clearly introduce pagination or lazy-loading.

Optimize database indexing and queries regularly.

AI Provider Rate Limits and Costs

Clearly monitor usage and implement API rate limiting.

Set up administrative alerts for usage spikes.
