## Strategic Database Planning Document

### App Summary
**End Goal:** Help knowledge workers achieve instant, intelligent access to insights from their documents using RAG-powered AI
**Template Used:** rag-saas
**Core Features:** Document upload & processing, RAG-powered chat, conversation history, subscription billing, usage tracking

---

## 🗄️ Current Database State

### Existing Tables (rag-saas Template)
- **`users`** - User accounts with Stripe subscription management (free/basic/pro tiers)
- **`conversations`** - Chat sessions with document context and user ownership  
- **`messages`** - Individual messages with multimodal attachments (JSONB)
- **`documents`** - Multi-format file storage (PDF, audio, video, images) with processing status
- **`document_chunks`** - Vector embeddings (768D text + 1408D multimodal) with metadata
- **`document_processing_jobs`** - Async processing pipeline with stage tracking
- **`user_usage_events`** - Time-window usage tracking for subscription enforcement

### Template Assessment  
**✅ Excellent Fit:** Your rag-saas template is perfectly designed for document intelligence workflows
**✅ Production Ready:** Advanced RAG pipeline with dual embedding strategy already implemented  
**🔧 Ready to Build:** All core features (document processing, AI chat, billing) fully supported

## ⚡ Feature-to-Schema Mapping

### Core Features (Ready to Build)
- **Document Upload & Processing** → Uses `documents` + `document_processing_jobs` - complete async pipeline
- **RAG-Powered Chat** → Uses `document_chunks` with vector embeddings + `conversations` - industry-leading implementation
- **Multi-format Support** → Uses `documents.file_category` enum (documents, images, videos, audio) - comprehensive
- **Conversation History** → Uses `conversations` + `messages` with document context - fully implemented
- **Subscription Billing** → Uses `users` Stripe integration + `user_usage_events` - complete foundation
- **Usage Tracking** → Uses time-window based events for document/request limits - sophisticated approach

### No New Tables Needed
Your RAG features map perfectly to the existing 7-table schema. The template was specifically designed for document intelligence platforms.

---

## 📋 Recommended Changes

**Bottom Line:** Your database is **production-ready** with **no changes needed** for core functionality.

### Current Schema Status
- **✅ Perfect As-Is:** All 7 core tables optimally designed for your use case
- **✅ Advanced RAG Support:** Dual embedding strategy (text + multimodal) with proper indexing
- **✅ Professional Features:** Async processing, error handling, subscription management
- **✅ Performance Optimized:** Proper indexes, foreign keys, cascade deletes

### Future Optimization Opportunities (Phase 2+)
- **Document Versioning:** Add versioning if users frequently update files
- **Conversation Archives:** Separate archived conversations if history grows very large
- **Team Features:** Add shared document collections for collaborative use

### Implementation Priority
1. **Phase 1 (MVP):** Use existing schema - it's already complete
2. **Phase 2 (Scale):** Monitor performance and add optimizations as needed

## 🎯 Strategic Advantage

Your rag-saas template choice was exceptional. The schema supports advanced features most competitors lack:

**Advanced RAG Capabilities:**
- **Dual Embedding Strategy** - Separate 768D text and 1408D multimodal embeddings
- **Vector Search Optimization** - HNSW indexes for fast similarity search
- **Multi-format Processing** - Documents, images, videos, audio with proper metadata
- **Async Processing Pipeline** - Professional document processing with stage tracking

**Enterprise-Ready Business Logic:**
- **Sophisticated Usage Tracking** - Time-window based limits (not simple counters)
- **Subscription Management** - Full Stripe integration with tier enforcement
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive processing error tracking and recovery

**Performance & Scalability:**
- **Proper Indexing** - All queries optimized with composite indexes
- **Cascade Deletes** - Clean data relationships and referential integrity
- **Type Safety** - Full Drizzle ORM with TypeScript and Zod validation

**Next Steps:** Start building features immediately - your database foundation is production-ready.

> **Development Approach:** The schema won't block any planned functionality. Focus on feature implementation using the existing robust foundation.
