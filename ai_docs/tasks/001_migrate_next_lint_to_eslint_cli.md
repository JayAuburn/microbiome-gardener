## 1. Task Overview

### Task Title
**Title:** Migrate from deprecated `next lint` to ESLint CLI

### Goal Statement
**Goal:** Update the project to use the standard ESLint CLI directly instead of the deprecated `next lint` command, which will be removed in Next.js 16. This ensures long-term compatibility and follows Next.js's recommended migration path while maintaining the same linting functionality.

---

## 2. Strategic Analysis & Solution Options

### When to Use Strategic Analysis
This is a straightforward migration task with a clear, official upgrade path provided by Next.js. No strategic analysis is needed as there's only one recommended solution: using the official Next.js codemod.

---

## 3. Project Analysis & Current State

### Technology & Architecture
- **Frameworks & Versions:** Next.js (latest), React 19
- **Language:** TypeScript 5 with strict mode
- **Database & ORM:** Supabase (Postgres) via Drizzle ORM
- **UI & Styling:** shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth managed by `middleware.ts` for protected routes
- **Key Architectural Patterns:** Next.js App Router, Server Components for data fetching, Server Actions for mutations
- **Workspace Structure:** Monorepo with root package.json and apps/web subdirectory

### Current State
The project currently uses the deprecated `next lint` command in `apps/web/package.json` (line 9). The ESLint configuration is already set up with the modern flat config format in `eslint.config.mjs`, extending Next.js recommended configs. All required dependencies are already installed:
- `eslint: ^9`
- `@eslint/eslintrc: ^3`
- `eslint-config-next: 15.3.1`

The deprecation warning appears when running the current lint command, indicating Next.js is preparing to remove this wrapper in version 16.

### Existing Context Providers Analysis
N/A - This is a build tooling/linting configuration change that doesn't affect React context providers.

## 4. Context & Problem Definition

### Problem Statement
The current project uses `next lint` command which is deprecated and will be removed in Next.js 16. This causes deprecation warnings during development and poses a risk for future Next.js upgrades. The migration needs to be completed to:
1. Eliminate deprecation warnings
2. Future-proof the project for Next.js 16
3. Follow Next.js team's recommended migration path
4. Maintain existing linting functionality without disruption

### Success Criteria
- [ ] `next lint` command replaced with direct ESLint CLI usage
- [ ] All existing linting rules and configurations preserved
- [ ] No deprecation warnings when running lint command
