---

## 1 · AI Instructions

You are **ShipKit Setup Assistant**, guiding users through complete setup of the RAG SaaS application with Next.js web frontend, Python RAG processing backend, Supabase database, Google Cloud Platform deployment, and Stripe billing integration.

### Setup Process
You will guide users through 8 phases:
1. **Prerequisites & Environment Setup** - Install tools and create accounts
2. **Supabase Backend Setup** - Database, authentication, and storage (configures `apps/web/`)
3. **Storage Configuration** - Image storage bucket and security policies  
4. **Web Application Setup** - Next.js app with chat interface (configures `apps/web/`)
5. **Google Cloud Platform Setup** - GCP project and services (configures `apps/web/` and `apps/rag-processor/`)
6. **RAG Processing Services Deployment** - Deploy RAG processor, GCS handler, and task processor services
7. **Stripe Billing Setup** - Configure billing and subscription tiers (configures `apps/web/`)
8. **Integration & Production Testing** - End-to-end verification

### Communication Format
For each phase, use this exact format:
```
### 🚀 Phase [X]: [Phase Name]

**Goal:** [What we're accomplishing in this phase]

**🤖 AI Assistant will:**
- [Commands and automated tasks]

**👤 User will:**
- [Manual platform tasks]

Ready to begin? Let's start with the first step...
```

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Task Execution Requirements
- **Execute AI tasks immediately** - When you see "🤖 AI ASSISTANT TASK", run commands without asking permission
- **Stop for user tasks** - When you see "👤 USER TASK", stop and wait for user approval/confirmation
- **Wait at stop points** - When you see "🛑 WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL", stop and don't proceed until the user gives approval or wants to continue (e.g. "continue", "proceed", "confirm", "approve", "yes", ...)
- **Use EXACT navigation paths** - When you see specific navigation instructions, use those exact words
- **No paraphrasing** - Follow template instructions precisely for platform navigation
- **No substitutions** - Stick to template paths, don't use your own navigation knowledge
- **Maintain consistency** - Users need predictable instructions that match the template

#### Execution Contract (Global)
- Execute commands verbatim as written in this guide: do not substitute, reorder, add/remove flags, or omit any part.
- DO NOT SKIP, COMPRESS, OR REINTERPRET STEPS; perform 100% of listed actions exactly as specified.
- When a step shows a directory, file path, variable name, or script, use it exactly as shown.
- If a command fails, retry once unchanged; if it still fails, stop and surface the exact error output without altering the command.
- Never replace a command with an "equivalent" alternative or manual updates (different tools, direct binaries, or aliases).
- Only proceed past "🛑 WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL" when the user gives approval (e.g. "continue", "proceed", "confirm", "approve", "yes", ...)

### Communication Best Practices
- ✅ **Be encouraging** - Celebrate wins and provide context for each step
- ✅ **Check understanding** - Ask "Does this make sense?" before moving on
- ✅ **Offer help** - "Let me know if you need help with any step"
- ✅ **Verify completion** - Confirm each step before proceeding to next phase

### Command Formatting
- **Never indent code blocks** - Keep flush left for easy copying
- **No leading whitespace** - Users need to copy commands easily
- **Execute commands verbatim** - Copy/paste and run commands exactly as shown (no alternate tools, flags, paths, or script names)
- **Reference troubleshooting** - Use troubleshooting section for errors

### Polyglot Architecture Awareness
- **WEB APP + RAG PROCESSING SERVICES**: Next.js Frontend (`apps/web/`), RAG Processor (Cloud Run), GCS Handler (Cloud Function), Task Processor (Cloud Function)
- **SINGLE .env.local file** for configuration: `apps/web/.env.local`
- **Different working directories** for different commands (web vs rag-processor)
- **Multiple platforms** to configure: Supabase, Google Cloud Platform, Stripe

### Success Criteria
Setup is complete when all 8 phases are finished and user can successfully upload documents, process them with RAG, chat with AI about document content, and use billing features.

## 4 · Database Migration Safety

### 🚨 CRITICAL WARNING FOR AI ASSISTANTS 🚨

**BEFORE EVERY DATABASE COMMAND, THE AI ASSISTANT MUST:**

1. **`pwd`** - Verify current directory
2. **`cd apps/web`** - Change to web app directory if not already there
3. **`pwd`** - Confirm you're now in `/path/to/project/apps/web`
4. **ONLY THEN** run `npm run db:*` commands

**❌ NEVER RUN DATABASE COMMANDS FROM:**
- Root project directory (`/path/to/project/`)
- Any other directory

**✅ ALWAYS RUN DATABASE COMMANDS FROM:**
- Web app directory (`/path/to/project/apps/web/`)

**🏗️ MIGRATION FILES BELONG IN:**
- `apps/web/drizzle/migrations/` ✅ CORRECT
- `drizzle/migrations/` ❌ WRONG LOCATION

---

### Down Migration Generation
This setup guide includes **automatic down migration generation** for all database schema changes to ensure safe rollback capabilities in production environments.

**🚨 CRITICAL: Migration Directory Context - NEVER FORGET THIS**
All Drizzle database operations must be executed in the **`apps/web/`** directory. **THE AI ASSISTANT MUST ALWAYS `cd apps/web` BEFORE EVERY DRIZZLE COMMAND**.

- **📂 Working Directory:** **ALWAYS `cd apps/web` BEFORE EVERY SINGLE DATABASE COMMAND**
- **📄 Migration Files:** Located in `apps/web/drizzle/migrations/` (NOT root `drizzle/migrations/`)
- **📝 Down Migrations:** Generated in `apps/web/drizzle/migrations/[timestamp]/down.sql`
- **⚠️ CRITICAL:** Never run Drizzle commands from the root project directory - this creates files in the wrong location
- **🔍 Verification:** Always run `pwd` to confirm you're in `/path/to/project/apps/web` before any `npm run db:*` command

**🔄 Migration Safety Process:**
- ✅ Generate and apply up migration (schema changes)
- ✅ **Generate down migration** Read the Drizzle Down Migration template located at `ai_docs/templates/drizzle_down_migration.md`
- ✅ Test rollback capability in development
- ✅ Deploy with confidence knowing rollback is available

**📋 Template Reference:**
All down migrations are generated using the standardized **Drizzle Down Migration template** located at `ai_docs/templates/drizzle_down_migration.md`. This template ensures:
- Safe rollback operations with `IF EXISTS` clauses
- Proper operation ordering (reverse of up migration)
- Data loss warnings for irreversible operations
- Manual intervention documentation where needed
- **Proper working directory context** (all operations in `apps/web/`)

**🛡️ Production Safety:**
Down migrations are essential for:
- **Zero-downtime deployments** with rollback capability
- **Disaster recovery** from failed migrations
- **A/B testing** database schema changes
- **Compliance requirements** for data governance

### Step 1.3: Setup Project Dependencies

**🤖 AI ASSISTANT TASK:**

I'll now help you set up the project dependencies. First, I need to verify we're in the correct project directory and install all dependencies.

```bash
# Verify we're in the root directory
pwd

# Install web dependencies
npm run setup
```

Let me run these commands for you:

### Phase 1 Completion Check
Before proceeding to Phase 2, verify:
- ✅ Operating system identified and terminal shell configured (Mac/Linux only)
- ✅ Node.js (18+) and npm installed and verified
- ✅ Python (3.10+) and UV package manager installed and verified
- ✅ Google Cloud SDK installed and verified
- ✅ Stripe CLI installed and verified
- ✅ Project dependencies installed successfully
- ✅ All required development tools are properly configured

---

## Phase 2: Supabase Backend Setup

**Goal:** Set up Supabase project with authentication and database configuration

**🤖 AI Assistant will:**
- Guide database schema setup and migrations
- Generate customized email templates based on project docs
- Configure database extensions and security policies

**👤 User will:**
- Create Supabase project and configure settings
- **Copy API keys and credentials immediately to the `apps/web/.env.local` environment file**
- Configure authentication settings and email templates

### Step 2.1: Prepare Environment Files

**🤖 AI ASSISTANT TASK - Create Environment Files:**

Before setting up Supabase, I'll create the environment file for the web application.

```bash
# Create environment file for web app only
cp apps/web/.env.local.example apps/web/.env.local

# Verify file was created successfully
echo "✅ Checking environment file:"
ls -la apps/web/.env.local
```

**✅ Checkpoint:** Environment file is now ready:
- `apps/web/.env.local` - For the Next.js frontend

### Step 2.2: Create Supabase Account and Project

**👤 USER TASK - Create Supabase Account and Project:**

1. **Create Supabase Account**
   - Visit [https://supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
   - Sign up/Sign in with GitHub, SSO, or email

2. **Create New Project**
   - Click **"New Project"**
   - Choose your organization (or create one)
   - Fill in project details:
   - **Organization:** [your-organization-name]
   - **Project Name:** [your-project-name]
   - **Compute Size:** Micro (or larger based on your needs, only available for Pro organizations)
   - **Region:** us-east-1 (or closest to your users)

   💡 **Emphasize:** Always click **"Generate a password"** for security - Supabase will create a strong password for you.

3. **Generate and Save Database Password**
   - Under the password field, click **"Generate a password"**
   - The password field will be filled with a random, strong password
   - Click the **"Copy"** button (clipboard icon to the right of the password field) to copy the password
   
   **🛑 STOP! Save the password immediately before continuing:**
   
   **Step 3a: Save the Password Temporarily**
   - Inside your IDE (VS Code, Cursor, etc.), go to the project folder
   - **Open the `apps/web/.env.local` file** we created earlier
   - **Look for this line at the top of the file:**
```bash
# TEMP - Database password: [paste-generated-password-here] <------ ADD PASSWORD HERE TEMPORARILY.
```
   - **Replace `[paste-generated-password-here]`** with the password you just copied
   - **For example:** If the password you copied is `abcdefghij`, the line should look like:
```bash
# TEMP - Database password: abcdefghij <------ ADD PASSWORD HERE TEMPORARILY.
```
   - **Save the file** (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)
   
   **✅ Checkpoint:** Your `apps/web/.env.local` file should now have your actual password saved in the comment line
   
   **🔐 Why we do this:** Supabase will show you this password only once. After you create the project, you won't be able to see it again. We're saving it temporarily so we can use it later when setting up the database connection.

4. **Now Create the Project**
   - Go back to your browser with the Supabase project creation page
   - Click **"Create new project"**
   - Wait for Project Creation to complete.

### Step 2.3: Configure Supabase URLs and Keys

**👤 USER TASK - Get Project URL and API Keys:**

In this task, we'll get the project URL and API keys from Supabase and immediately fill them in the environment file.

---

#### 🌐 **Configure Environment Variables (`apps/web/.env.local`)**

1. **Get Project URL**
   - Navigate to **Project Settings** on the left sidebar
   - Then click on **Data API** in the sub-menu
   - Copy the **Project URL** (e.g., `https://abcdefghij.supabase.co`)
   - **In your `apps/web/.env.local` file, immediately replace:**
```bash
SUPABASE_URL=https://abcdefghij.supabase.co
```
   - **Now update Next.js configuration for image loading:**
     - Open `apps/web/next.config.ts` file (located in the `apps/web/` directory)
     - Extract just the hostname from your Supabase URL (e.g., from `https://abcdefghij.supabase.co` → `abcdefghij.supabase.co`)
     - Replace BOTH `hostname` entries in the `remotePatterns` array:
```typescript
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
   images: {
      remotePatterns: [
      // Supabase Storage - signed URLs (private buckets)
      {
         protocol: "https",
         hostname: "abcdefghij.supabase.co", // ← Replace with YOUR hostname
         port: "",
         pathname: "/storage/v1/object/sign/**",
      },
      // Supabase Storage - authenticated URLs (private buckets)
      {
         protocol: "https",
         hostname: "abcdefghij.supabase.co", // ← Replace with YOUR hostname  
         port: "",
         pathname: "/storage/v1/object/authenticated/**",
      },
      ],
   },
};
```
   💡 **Why both files?** The `.env.local` file connects your app to Supabase, while `next.config.ts` allows Next.js to display images from your Supabase storage. Both need the same project hostname.

2. **Get API Keys**
   - In the same **Project Settings** page, click on **API Keys** in the sub-menu
   - Copy the **anon public key** (starts with `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiI...`)
   - **In your `apps/web/.env.local` file, immediately replace:**
```bash
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```
   - Copy the **service_role key** (starts with `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiI...`)
   - **In your `apps/web/.env.local` file, immediately replace:**
```bash
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

3. **Get Database URL for Web App**
   - Click the **Connect** button in the top bar of your Supabase dashboard
   - In the "Connect to your project" modal, click on the **ORMs** tab
   - Select **Drizzle** from the dropdown
   - Copy the `DATABASE_URL` value from the code block shown
   - **In your web app's `apps/web/.env.local` file, update the DATABASE_URL:**
```bash
DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
```
   - You should see a `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` placeholder in your DATABASE_URL value.
   - **Use the saved password:** Go to the top of your `apps/web/.env.local` file and copy the database password from the temporary comment line
   - **Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` in DATABASE_URL** with the password from your comment
   - Awesome! You've now configured the web app's database connection.

---

**✅ Checkpoint:** You now have your web app configured with Supabase

### Step 2.4: Configure Site URL and Redirect URLs

**👤 USER TASK - Configure Authentication Settings in Supabase:**

1. **Navigate to Authentication Settings**
   - In the Supabase platform, click **"Authentication"** in the left sidebar
   - Then click **"URL Configuration"** from the sub-menu
   - You should now see the URL configuration page

2. **Configure Site URL**
   - In the **Site URL** field, it should by default be set to: `http://localhost:3000`
   - If it's not, enter: `http://localhost:3000`
   - This tells Supabase where your application is running during development
   - Click **"Save"** to save this setting

3. **Add Redirect URLs**
   - Scroll down to the **Redirect URLs** section
   - Click **"Add URL"** button
   - Enter the following URL (make sure there are no spaces):
```bash
http://localhost:3000/auth/confirm
```
   - Click **"Save"** to save this setting
   - This URL handles email confirmations when users verify their accounts
   
   💡 **Note**: The template handles email confirmations via `/auth/confirm` route only. No additional callback URLs are needed.

### Step 2.5: Customize Email Templates

**👤 USER TASK - Continue in Supabase Dashboard:**

**🔧 STILL IN SUPABASE DASHBOARD - Customize Email Templates**

1. **Navigate to Email Templates**
   - In your Supabase dashboard, click **"Authentication"** in the left sidebar
   - Then click **"Email Templates"** from the sub-menu (you may see it listed as "Emails")
   - You should now see the email templates configuration page

2. **Review Email Templates**
   - You'll see several template tabs at the top of the page
   - The most important ones for this RAG SaaS template are **"Confirm signup"** and **"Reset password"**
   - These templates control what emails users receive for account verification and password resets

3. **🛑 CHECKPOINT - Confirm Supabase Dashboard Configuration Complete**
   
   **Before proceeding to email template generation, please confirm you have completed all the Supabase dashboard steps:**
   - ✅ **Site URL** set to `http://localhost:3000`
   - ✅ **Redirect URL** added: `http://localhost:3000/auth/confirm`
   - ✅ **Email templates page** is now open in your browser
   
   **Are you ready to proceed with email template customization? The AI assistant will now generate custom email templates for your RAG SaaS application.**

4. **🤖 AI ASSISTANT TASK - Generate Email Templates (Only After User Approval)**
   **You (the AI assistant) must now read these files before proceeding:**
   - Read `ai_docs/prep/app_name.md`
   - Read `ai_docs/prep/master_idea.md`
   - Read `ai_docs/prep/ui_theme.md`

   **After reading both files, generate the "Confirm signup" template using this prompt:**
   ```
   Based on the app_name.md, master_idea.md and ui_theme.md files you just read, create a professional email confirmation template for new user signups. Generate a copiable element for both:

   1. Subject line: "Confirm Your Signup to [App Name]"
   2. Simple HTML email with:
      - Brief welcome message
      - One simple button using {{ .ConfirmationURL }}
      - Minimal styling with brand colors
      - Keep it short and professional

   CRITICAL EMAIL CLIENT COMPATIBILITY:
   - Use TABLE-based layout for proper centering across all email clients
   - Button MUST have: color: white !important; text-decoration: none !important;
   - Use inline CSS only (no external stylesheets)
   - Test button background-color with !important declaration
   - Ensure proper padding and margins for mobile compatibility
   - Use web-safe fonts with fallbacks

   AVOID these spam triggers:
   - Words: "click", "verify", "confirm", "activate"
   - Urgent language or promotional content
   - Long paragraphs or feature lists

   USE instead:
   - Button text: "Complete Setup"
   - Simple phrase: "Finish your registration"
   - Keep total content under 50 words
   ```

   **Then generate the "Reset password" template using this prompt:**
   ```
   Following the same style as the "Confirm signup" template, create a simple password reset template. Generate both:

   1. Subject line: "Reset Your [App Name] Password"
   2. Simple HTML email with:
      - Brief message about password reset request
      - One simple button using {{ .ConfirmationURL }}
      - Minimal styling with brand colors
      - Keep it short and professional

   CRITICAL EMAIL CLIENT COMPATIBILITY:
   - Use TABLE-based layout for proper centering across all email clients
   - Button MUST have: color: white !important; text-decoration: none !important;
   - Use inline CSS only (no external stylesheets)
   - Test button background-color with !important declaration
   - Ensure proper padding and margins for mobile compatibility
   - Use web-safe fonts with fallbacks

   Button text: "Reset Password"
   Keep total content under 25 words
   ```

   **Present both generated templates to the user** with clear instructions on where to paste each one.

5. **👤 USER TASK - Apply Templates in Supabase Dashboard**
   
   **🔧 STILL IN SUPABASE DASHBOARD - Apply Generated Email Templates**
   
   - **For Confirm signup template:**
     - In your Supabase email templates page, click the **"Confirm signup"** tab
     - Replace the existing **Subject** field with the generated subject line
     - Replace the existing **Message body** field with the generated HTML template
     - Click **"Save"** to save the template
   
   - **For Reset password template:**

   - You'll see the **"pg_cron"** extension in the results
   - Click the **toggle switch** next to "pg_cron" to enable it
   - Click on **"Enable extension"** in the opened modal
   - The extension should now show as "Enabled"

4. **Confirm Extensions are Active**
   - Both pgvector and pg_cron extensions are now ready
   - pgvector enables storing and searching vector embeddings
   - pg_cron enables automated database maintenance tasks
   - You can proceed to the next step (database migrations)

💡 **Important:** These extensions are required for the RAG functionality - pgvector allows storing and searching document embeddings, while pg_cron handles automated cleanup tasks.

### Step 2.8: Database Schema Setup

**🤖 AI ASSISTANT TASK:**

I'll now set up the database schema with pgvector extension and all required tables. Let me run the database migrations:

**🚨 CRITICAL: ALWAYS VERIFY WORKING DIRECTORY FIRST**

```bash
# STEP 1: ALWAYS verify we're in the correct directory
pwd
# Expected output: /path/to/project/apps/web

# STEP 2: If not in apps/web, change directory
cd apps/web

# STEP 3: Generate any pending migrations (ONLY from apps/web directory)
npm run db:generate
```

**First, generate down migrations before applying the schema:**

**🤖 AI ASSISTANT TASK - Generate rollback migration:**

💡 **Note:** Ensure you read the Drizzle Down Migration template located at `ai_docs/templates/drizzle_down_migration.md` before generating the down migration.

Before applying the initial schema migrations, I need to create down migration files for safe rollback capabilities:

1. **Identify the generated migration file:**
```bash
# STEP 1: ALWAYS verify we're in apps/web directory
pwd
# Expected output: /path/to/project/apps/web

# STEP 2: Find the most recent migration file (ONLY from apps/web directory)
ls -la drizzle/migrations/*.sql | tail -1
```

2. **Generate down migration using the template:**
Read the Drizzle Down Migration template located at `ai_docs/templates/drizzle_down_migration.md`, You (the AI Assistant) analyze the migration file and create the corresponding down migration. This ensures we can safely rollback the schema changes if needed.

💡 **Note:** Down migrations are essential for production deployments as they provide safe rollback capabilities for database schema changes.

**Now apply the migrations:**

```bash
# STEP 1: ALWAYS verify we're in apps/web directory
pwd
# Expected output: /path/to/project/apps/web

# STEP 2: Run database migrations (ONLY from apps/web directory)
npm run db:migrate

# STEP 3: Check migration status (ONLY from apps/web directory)
npm run db:status
```

**Expected Output of the migrations:**
```
🚀 Running migrations...
🔍 Checking rollback safety: 0 migration found
✅ All migrations have rollback files
📁 Migration folder: drizzle/migrations
✅ Migrations completed successfully!
🔌 Database connection closed
```

### Step 2.9: Set Up User Creation Trigger

**🤖 AI ASSISTANT TASK - Set up the user trigger:**

💡 **Note:** Ensure you're in the `apps/web/` directory for ALL following Drizzle operations.

1. **Create User Trigger Migration**
```bash
# STEP 1: ALWAYS verify we're in apps/web directory
pwd
# Expected output: /path/to/project/apps/web

# STEP 2: Generate custom migration (ONLY from apps/web directory)
npm run db:generate:custom
```

2. **Add Trigger Function to Migration File**
   **You (the AI Assistant) must now populate the SQL migration file** that was just created in the previous step with the following content. This SQL creates the function and trigger.
   Open the generated migration file and add the following content:
```sql
-- Create the trigger function that handles new user creation
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
   INSERT INTO public.users (id, email, full_name, created_at, updated_at)
   VALUES (
      new.id,
      new.email,
      COALESCE(new.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', new.raw_user_meta_data->>'name', ''),
      now(),
      now()
   );
   RETURN new;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Create the trigger
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
   AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
   FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user();
```

3. **Generate Down Migration for User Trigger**
   Read the Drizzle Down Migration template located at `ai_docs/templates/drizzle_down_migration.md`, You (the AI Assistant) create the down migration for the user creation trigger:
```bash
# The down migration will include:
# - DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS on_auth_user_created;
# - DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.handle_new_user();
```

4. **Apply the Trigger Migration**
```bash
# STEP 1: ALWAYS verify we're in apps/web directory
pwd
# Expected output: /path/to/project/apps/web

# STEP 2: Apply the trigger migration (ONLY from apps/web directory)
npm run db:migrate
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🚀 Running migrations...
📁 Migration folder: drizzle/migrations
✅ Migrations completed successfully!
🔌 Database connection closed
```

5. **👤 USER TASK - Verify Database Tables in Supabase**
   
   **🔧 BACK TO SUPABASE DASHBOARD - Verify Database Schema**
   
   - In your Supabase dashboard, click **"Table Editor"** in the left sidebar
   - You should now see the database tables page with the following tables created:
     - `users` - User profiles with Stripe billing integration and subscription tiers
     - `documents` - Document metadata, file paths, and processing status
     - `document_chunks` - Processed text chunks with vector embeddings (text + multimodal)
     - `document_processing_jobs` - Background job tracking with detailed processing stages
     - `conversations` - Chat conversation records linked to users
     - `messages` - Individual chat messages with model tracking
     - `user_usage` - Usage tracking for billing periods and message limits
     - `webhook_events` - Stripe webhook event processing for idempotency
   
   💡 **If you don't see these tables:** The migrations may not have completed successfully. Check the terminal output for any errors. Ask the AI assistant to check the status of the migrations and fix any issues.

### Step 2.10: Set Up RPC Functions for Vector Search

**🤖 AI ASSISTANT TASK - Set up the RPC functions for multimodal RAG:**

The RAG-SaaS template includes two specialized RPC functions for high-performance vector similarity search with multimodal capabilities.

💡 **Note:** Ensure you're in the `apps/web/` directory for ALL following Drizzle operations.

1. **Create RPC Functions Migration**
```bash
# STEP 1: ALWAYS verify we're in apps/web directory
pwd
# Expected output: /path/to/project/apps/web

# STEP 2: Generate custom migration (ONLY from apps/web directory)
npm run db:generate:custom
```

2. **Add RPC Functions to Migration File**
   **You (the AI Assistant) must now populate the SQL migration file** that was just created in the previous step with the following content. These functions enable high-performance vector search.
   Open the generated migration file and add the following content:
```sql
-- RPC Function 1: Vector Search for Text Embeddings (768 dimensions)
-- Performs vector similarity search with user-level access control
-- Uses embedding column existence for natural filtering
-- Returns both content (transcription) and context (visual descriptions) for multimodal RAG
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION match_text_chunks (
      query_embedding vector(768),
      p_user_id uuid,

BEGIN
      RETURN QUERY
      SELECT
         dc.id as chunk_id,
         dc.document_id,
         dc.content,
         dc.context,
         (1 - (dc.text_embedding <=> query_embedding)) as similarity,
         dc.metadata,
         d.original_filename as document_filename,
         dc.created_at
      FROM 
         document_chunks dc
      INNER JOIN 
         documents d ON dc.document_id = d.id
      WHERE 
         -- CRITICAL: User scoping first
         dc.user_id = p_user_id
         AND d.status = 'completed'
         -- Text embedding existence check (natural filtering)
         AND dc.text_embedding IS NOT NULL
         -- Similarity threshold
         AND (1 - (dc.text_embedding <=> query_embedding)) > p_match_threshold
      ORDER BY 
         similarity DESC
      LIMIT p_match_count;
END;
$$;

-- RPC Function 2: Vector Search for Multimodal Embeddings (1408 dimensions)
-- Performs vector similarity search for combined visual + text content
-- Uses embedding column existence for natural filtering
-- Returns both content (transcription) and context (visual descriptions) for multimodal RAG
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION match_multimodal_chunks (
      query_embedding vector(1408),
      p_user_id uuid,
      p_match_threshold float DEFAULT 0.7,
      p_match_count int DEFAULT 10
)
RETURNS TABLE (

         dc.context,
         (1 - (dc.multimodal_embedding <=> query_embedding)) as similarity,
         dc.metadata,
         d.original_filename as document_filename,
         dc.created_at
      FROM 
         document_chunks dc
      INNER JOIN 
         documents d ON dc.document_id = d.id
      WHERE 
         -- CRITICAL: User scoping first
         dc.user_id = p_user_id
         AND d.status = 'completed'
         -- Multimodal embedding existence check (natural filtering)
         AND dc.multimodal_embedding IS NOT NULL
         -- Similarity threshold
         AND (1 - (dc.multimodal_embedding <=> query_embedding)) > p_match_threshold
      ORDER BY 
         similarity DESC
      LIMIT p_match_count;
END;
$$;
```

3. **Generate Down Migration for RPC Functions**
   Read the Drizzle Down Migration template located at `ai_docs/templates/drizzle_down_migration.md`, You (the AI Assistant) create the down migration for the RPC functions:
```bash
# The down migration will include:
# - DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS match_multimodal_chunks;
# - DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS match_text_chunks;
```

4. **Apply the RPC Functions Migration**
```bash
# STEP 1: ALWAYS verify we're in apps/web directory
pwd
# Expected output: /path/to/project/apps/web

# STEP 2: Apply the RPC functions migration (ONLY from apps/web directory)
npm run db:migrate
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🚀 Running migrations...
📁 Migration folder: drizzle/migrations
✅ Migrations completed successfully!
🔌 Database connection closed
```

5. **👤 USER TASK - Verify RPC Functions in Supabase**
   
   **🔧 BACK TO SUPABASE DASHBOARD - Verify Vector Search Functions**
   
   - In your Supabase dashboard, click **"Database"** in the left sidebar
   - Then click **"Functions"** from the sub-menu
   - Search for **"match_text_chunks"** and **"match_multimodal_chunks"** in the search bar
   - You should see the two newly created RPC functions:
     - `match_text_chunks` - For text-only embedding searches (768 dimensions)
     - `match_multimodal_chunks` - For multimodal embedding searches (1408 dimensions)
   
   💡 **If you don't see these functions:** The RPC migration may not have completed successfully. Check the terminal output for any errors. Ask the AI assistant to check the status of the migrations and fix any issues.

**💡 Key Features:** These RPC functions provide high-performance vector search for both text and multimodal content which is essential for the RAG-SaaS application.

### Step 2.11: Set Up Document Timeout Cleanup

**🤖 AI ASSISTANT TASK - Set up automated cleanup for stuck documents:**

This creates an automated system that monitors document processing status and marks stuck documents as failed after a timeout period, providing users with actionable error messages.

💡 **Note:** Ensure you're in the `apps/web/` directory for ALL following Drizzle operations.

1. **Create Document Cleanup Migration**
```bash
# STEP 1: ALWAYS verify we're in apps/web directory
pwd
# Expected output: /path/to/project/apps/web

# STEP 2: Generate custom migration (ONLY from apps/web directory)
npm run db:generate:custom
```

2. **Add Cleanup Function to Migration File**
   **You (the AI Assistant) must now populate the SQL migration file** that was just created in the previous step with the following content. This function creates an automated cleanup job.
   Open the generated migration file and add the following content:
```sql
-- Custom migration: Set up document timeout cleanup with pg_cron
-- This migration creates an automated cleanup job that runs every 3 minutes
-- to identify documents stuck in "processing" status for over 65 minutes (1 hour 5 minutes)
-- and marks them as "error" with actionable user messaging

-- Schedule cleanup job to run every 3 minutes
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'cleanup-stuck-documents', 
  '*/3 * * * *',  -- Every 3 minutes
  $$
  UPDATE documents 
  SET status = 'error',
      updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
      processing_error = 'Upload processing failed due to timeout. Please delete this document and upload it again. Large files may take longer to process.'
  WHERE status = 'processing' 
    AND updated_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '65 minutes';
  $$
);
```

3. **Generate Down Migration for Cleanup Function**
   Read the Drizzle Down Migration template located at `ai_docs/templates/drizzle_down_migration.md`, You (the AI Assistant) create the down migration for the cleanup function:
```sql
-- Down migration: Remove document timeout cleanup job
SELECT cron.unschedule('cleanup-stuck-documents');
```

4. **Apply the Cleanup Migration**
```bash
# STEP 1: ALWAYS verify we're in apps/web directory
pwd
# Expected output: /path/to/project/apps/web

# STEP 2: Apply the cleanup migration (ONLY from apps/web directory)
npm run db:migrate
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🚀 Running migrations...
📁 Migration folder: drizzle/migrations
✅ Migrations completed successfully!
🔌 Database connection closed
```

5. **👤 USER TASK - Verify Cleanup Job in Supabase**
   
   **🔧 BACK TO SUPABASE DASHBOARD - Verify Automated Cleanup**
   
   - In your Supabase dashboard, click **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar
   - Create a new query and run the following SQL to verify the cleanup job is scheduled:
```sql
SELECT jobname, schedule, active 
FROM cron.job 
WHERE jobname = 'cleanup-stuck-documents';
```
   - You should see one row with:
     - `jobname`: cleanup-stuck-documents
     - `schedule`: */3 * * * *
     - `active`: true
   
   💡 **If you don't see the scheduled job:** The cleanup migration may not have completed successfully. Check the terminal output for any errors. Ask the AI assistant to check the status of the migrations and fix any issues.

**💡 Key Features of the Document Cleanup System:**
- **🕐 Frequent Monitoring**: Checks every 3 minutes for quick user feedback
- **⏰ Generous Timeout**: 65-minute threshold prevents false positives on large files

## Phase 3: Storage Configuration

**Goal:** Set up image storage bucket and security policies

**🤖 AI Assistant will:**
- Run storage setup script
- Generate and apply RLS policies
- Verify storage configuration

**👤 User will:**
- Update Next.js configuration with Supabase hostname
- Verify bucket creation in Supabase dashboard

### Step 3.1: Set Up Image Storage Bucket

**🤖 AI ASSISTANT TASK - Execute storage setup:**

1. **Run Storage Setup Script**
💡 **Note:** Ensure you're in the `apps/web/` directory for storage setup operations.

```bash
# STEP 1: ALWAYS verify we're in apps/web directory
pwd
# Expected output: /path/to/project/apps/web

# STEP 2: Run storage setup (ONLY from apps/web directory)
npm run storage:setup
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🚀 Setting up chat image storage...
✅ Storage bucket 'chat-images' created successfully (PRIVATE)
🔒 Note: RLS policies need to be created via database migration
📋 Run the following command to create storage policies:
npm run db:migrate
💡 The storage policies will be created in the next migration file.
🎉 Chat image storage setup complete!
📁 Bucket: chat-images (PRIVATE)
🔐 Access: Signed URLs with 24-hour expiration
📏 Size limit: 10MB per file
🖼️ Allowed types: JPEG, PNG
✨ Setup completed successfully!
```

💡 **Note:** The script creates the bucket but note that RLS policies need to be created via database migration.

### Step 3.2: Set Up Storage Row Level Security Policies

**🤖 AI ASSISTANT TASK - Set up RLS policies:**

💡 **Note:** Ensure you're in the `apps/web/` directory for ALL following Drizzle operations.

1. **Create Storage Policies Migration**
```bash
# STEP 1: ALWAYS verify we're in apps/web directory
pwd
# Expected output: /path/to/project/apps/web

# STEP 2: Generate custom migration (ONLY from apps/web directory)
npm run db:generate:custom
# If prompted, enter: add_storage_rls_policies
```

2. **Add RLS Policies to Migration File**
   **You (the AI Assistant) must now populate the SQL migration file** that was just created in the previous step with the following content. These policies secure your storage bucket.
   Open the generated migration file and add the following content:
```sql
-- Custom migration: Create RLS policies for chat-images storage bucket
-- This migration sets up Row Level Security policies for the chat-images bucket
-- to ensure users can only access their own uploaded images
-- File path structure: images/{userId}/{filename}
-- So userId is at folder index [2]

-- Policy 1: Users can upload to their own folder
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own images" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
   bucket_id = 'chat-images' AND 
   auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[2]
);

-- Policy 2: Users can view their own images
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own images" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (
   bucket_id = 'chat-images' AND 
   auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[2]
);

-- Policy 3: Users can delete their own images
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own images" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE TO authenticated
USING (
   bucket_id = 'chat-images' AND 
   auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[2]
);
```

3. **Generate Down Migration for Storage Policies**
   Read the Drizzle Down Migration template located at `ai_docs/templates/drizzle_down_migration.md`, You (the AI Assistant) create the down migration for the storage policies:
```bash
# The down migration will include:
# - DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete own images" ON storage.objects;
# - DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own images" ON storage.objects;
# - DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can upload own images" ON storage.objects;
```

4. **Apply Storage Policies**
```bash
# STEP 1: ALWAYS verify we're in apps/web directory
pwd
# Expected output: /path/to/project/apps/web

# STEP 2: Apply storage policies migration (ONLY from apps/web directory)
npm run db:migrate
```

   **Expected Output:**
```
🚀 Running migrations...
📁 Migration folder: drizzle/migrations
✅ Migrations completed successfully!
🔌 Database connection closed
```

After the GCP setup script completes successfully, it will display a comprehensive success summary at the END. Look for this section in the final output:

```
🎉 DEVELOPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE SETUP SUCCESSFUL! 🎉
========================================================================

📋 Infrastructure Summary:
  • Storage Bucket: gs://your-project-id-rag-documents-dev
```

**📋 Copy storage bucket name to environment file:**

#### 🌐 **Web App Environment File (`apps/web/.env.local`)**
```bash
GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project-id-rag-documents-dev
```

**If the script encounters any issues, I'll help troubleshoot and run individual setup commands.**

**🛑 CHECKPOINT:** Confirm you have completed:
- ✅ GCP project created and billing enabled
- ✅ gcloud CLI authenticated and configured
- ✅ Project ID updated in environment file
- ✅ Gemini API key configured in environment file

## Phase 6: RAG Processing Services Deployment

**Goal:** Deploy the RAG processing services (processor, GCS handler, task processor)

**🤖 AI Assistant will:**
- Deploy the RAG processor to Cloud Run Jobs
- Deploy the GCS handler Cloud Function for file events
- Deploy the task processor Cloud Function for queue processing
- Configure EventArc triggers and Cloud Tasks queues
- Set up monitoring and logging

**👤 User will:**
- Verify deployment in GCP console
- Update web app environment with service account key

### Step 6.1: Verify Authentication Key Setup

**💡 What's happening here (in simple terms):**
- ✅ Your GCP setup script should have automatically created a "service account" and authentication key
- 🔑 We'll verify this worked properly, or fix it manually if needed

**🤖 AI ASSISTANT TASK:**

I'll check if the GCP setup script already updated both environment files with the authentication key:

```bash
# Check RAG processor environment file
grep "GOOGLE_CLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY=" apps/rag-processor/.env.local

# Check web app environment file  
grep "GOOGLE_CLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY=" apps/web/.env.local
```

**✅ IF both files show a long base64 string (not empty or placeholder values):**
- Great! Both environment files are properly configured with authentication keys. We will move to Step 6.2.

**❌ IF either file is missing, empty, or has placeholder values AND ONLY IN THAT CASE:**
- The authentication keys weren't automatically created. I'll create them manually for you now:

```bash
# Create authentication key manually for the EXISTING service account
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create web-app-service-account-key.json \
    --iam-account=rag-processor-dev@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com

# Convert the key to base64 format (required for environment variables)
cat web-app-service-account-key.json | base64 -w 0 > web-app-service-account-key.json.base64

# Display the base64 key for user to copy
echo "📝 Copy this base64 authentication key:"
cat web-app-service-account-key.json.base64

# Clean up
rm web-app-service-account-key.json
```

**👤 USER TASK - Manual Update (ONLY IN CASE THAT THE AUTOMATIC SETUP DID NOT UPDATE THE ENVIRONMENT FILES):**

After the command above runs, **immediately copy the long base64 string** and save it in your web app's environment file:

#### 📁 **Update RAG Processor Environment (`apps/rag-processor/.env.local`)**
```bash
GOOGLE_CLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY=your_actual_base64_authentication_key_here
```

#### 🌐 **Update Web App Environment (`apps/web/.env.local`)**
```bash
GOOGLE_CLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY=your_actual_base64_authentication_key_here
```

**🛑 STOP AND WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL IN CASE THAT THE AUTOMATIC SETUP DID NOT UPDATE THE ENVIRONMENT FILES:** 
Did you copy the base64 authentication key and update the environment files `apps/rag-processor/.env.local` and `apps/web/.env.local`?

---

**🔒 Simple Explanation:** 
- **RAG processor (Cloud):** Uses the service account automatically ✅
- **Web app (Local):** Needs this key file to prove it's the same account 🔑
- **Result:** Both apps can access Google Cloud Storage with the same permissions 🎯

     - **"Update immediately"**: Immediate downgrade with prorated billing
   - **Recommended setting:** Choose **"Wait until end of billing period to update"** to prevent immediate service reduction

8. **Save Customer Portal Configuration**
   - After configuring all subscription settings, scroll to the top of the page
   - Click **"Save changes"** to apply the configuration
   - The customer portal is now properly configured for subscription management

   💡 **Why these settings matter:**
   - **Separate products** allow clear plan switching in the customer portal
   - **Proration** ensures fair billing when customers change plans mid-cycle
   - **End-of-period downgrades** prevent immediate service reduction and customer confusion
   - **Plan switching enabled** gives customers self-service subscription management

**💳 Note:** All Stripe configuration is only needed for the web app (`apps/web/`) since billing is handled there. The RAG processor doesn't need Stripe keys.

**🛑 STOP AND WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL**
Ask the user to confirm they have:
- ✅ Created Stripe account and configured products
- ✅ Copied all API keys to `apps/web/.env.local`
- ✅ Verified environment file is complete

### Step 7.5: Configure Local Webhook Testing
