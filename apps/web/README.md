## Demo

You can view a fully working demo at [demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app](https://demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app/).

## Deploy to Vercel

Vercel deployment will guide you through creating a Supabase account and project.

After installation of the Supabase integration, all relevant environment variables will be assigned to the project so the deployment is fully functioning.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&project-name=nextjs-with-supabase&repository-name=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-title=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-description=This+starter+configures+Supabase+Auth+to+use+cookies%2C+making+the+user%27s+session+available+throughout+the+entire+Next.js+app+-+Client+Components%2C+Server+Components%2C+Route+Handlers%2C+Server+Actions+and+Middleware.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2F&external-id=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2Fopengraph-image.png)

The above will also clone the Starter kit to your GitHub, you can clone that locally and develop locally.

If you wish to just develop locally and not deploy to Vercel, [follow the steps below](#clone-and-run-locally).

## Clone and run locally

1. You'll first need a Supabase project which can be made [via the Supabase dashboard](https://database.new)

2. Create a Next.js app using the Supabase Starter template npx command

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

   ```bash
   yarn create next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

   ```bash
   pnpm create next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

3. Use `cd` to change into the app's directory

   ```bash
   cd with-supabase-app
   ```

4. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` and update the following:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT URL]
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT API ANON KEY]
   ```

   Both `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` can be found in [your Supabase project's API settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true)

5. You can now run the Next.js local development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The starter kit should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

6. This template comes with the default shadcn/ui style initialized. If you instead want other ui.shadcn styles, delete `components.json` and [re-install shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next)

## Local Development with Stripe Webhooks

This application includes Stripe subscription integration that requires webhook events for real-time subscription updates. To test webhooks during local development:

### Prerequisites

1. Install the [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli)
2. Authenticate with your Stripe account:
   ```bash
   stripe login
   ```

### Setting up Webhooks

1. **Forward webhook events to your local server:**

   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
   ```

2. **Copy the webhook signing secret** from the CLI output (starts with `whsec_`) and add it to your `.env.local`:

   ```bash
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here
   ```

3. **Add other required Stripe environment variables** to your `.env.local`:

   ```bash
   # Stripe Configuration
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here
   STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_publishable_key_here
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here

   # Stripe Product IDs (configure these in your Stripe Dashboard)
   STRIPE_BASIC_PRICE_ID=price_your_basic_price_id_here
   STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID=price_your_pro_price_id_here
   ```

### Testing Webhook Events

With the Stripe CLI running, you can trigger test webhook events:

```bash
# Test a successful subscription creation
stripe trigger customer.subscription.created

# Test a subscription update
stripe trigger customer.subscription.updated

# Test a subscription cancellation
stripe trigger customer.subscription.deleted
```

### Important Notes

- **Keep the Stripe CLI running** in a separate terminal while developing
- The webhook endpoint `/api/webhooks/stripe` will receive and process these events
- Webhook events are used to sync subscription status between Stripe and your application database
- All webhook events are verified using the signing secret for security

### Stripe Dashboard Setup

Before testing subscriptions, configure the following in your [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com):

1. **Products**: Create Basic ($9.99/month) and Pro ($19.99/month) subscription products
2. **Prices**: Note the price IDs and add them to your environment variables
3. **Customer Portal**: Configure the customer portal for subscription management

> Check out [the docs for Local Development](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/local-development) to also run Supabase locally.
