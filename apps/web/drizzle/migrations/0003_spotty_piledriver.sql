-- Custom migration: Set up document timeout cleanup with pg_cron
-- This migration creates an automated cleanup job that runs every 3 minutes
-- to identify documents stuck in "processing" status for over 65 minutes (1 hour 5 minutes)
-- and marks them as "error" with actionable user messaging

-- Schedule cleanup job to run every 3 minutes
